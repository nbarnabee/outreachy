#   **TESTING TASK 1**:  

# Examining the output of the fetch request in the example code block, I can see that, within the "annotations" dict of pywikibot, the following fields have no value:

# wikidata_quid
# replaced_by
# for_wikis
# icon
# tool_type
# repository
# api_url
# user_docs_url
# feedback_url
# privacy_policy_url
# translate_url
# bug_tracker_url

# However, most of these have values contained within the Core tool info.  If I eliminate the ones that are assigned values in the Core tool info, and eliminate "replaced_by" (since the tool is not deprecated, the absence of a value here is expected), I'm left with the following:
# wikidata_qid,
# api_url,
# feedback_url,
# privacy_policy_url

# So I would expect that calling `list_missing_fields("pywikibot")` would return the following list: `['wikidata_quid', 'api_url', 'feedback_url', 'privacy_policy_url']`
