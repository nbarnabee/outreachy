    "#### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In my opinion, they would certainly not be equally valuable from the PoV of a user searching for a tool to use.  A user who wants to make use of a tool would be most interested in the context in which the tool would be used (i.e., \"tool_type\") or in documentation pertaining to the tool's use (e.g., \"user_docs_url\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On the other hand, a user who was looking to make a contribution would be more interested in fields such as \"repository,\" \"developer_docs_url,\" or \"bug_tracker_url.\"  Users will seek information that will assist them in achieving their goals, so naturally users with different goals (in this case, working *with* a tool vs. working *on* a tool) will be interested in different pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I would like include \"replaced_by\" in both the most *and* least valuable lists, simply because if the tool isn't depreciated, then the value of the field is of no importance whatsoever, but if the tool *is* depreciated, then it is *extremely* important.  (I know I keep banging on about this field.)  But since that feels a bit like cheating, I'll consider \"replaced_by\" a *special* case and list the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most valuable**\n",
    "1. repository: A well-written repository would likely contain information pertaining to the following fields as well: \"developer_docs_url\", \"user_docs_url\", \"feedback_url\", \"deprecated\" and \"bugtracker_url.\"  In this way one entry can cover multiple bases, as it were.  If we had one thing to encourage contributors to this project to look for and add, it would be (in my opinion) a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. deprecated:  This field provides critical information: a non-functional tool is of no use to a user and a contributor's time would be better spent working on the replacement tool\n",
    "\n",
    "3. user_docs_url: What is the use of having access to a tool if you can't figure out how to use it? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least valuable**\n",
    "1.  icon: This is purely cosmetic and contains no useful information either for a user or a contributor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  wikidata_qid: A string for use with the Wikidata query service, which I'm guessing would be used to cross-reference information, but I cannot find any explanation about how this would be generated.  But doing some digging, it seems that  someone would have to make a Wikidata entry for the tool, which would then generate the qid, which could then be manually attached to the tool on Toolhub.  If that's the case, then it seems like it would be a lot to ask of a random volunteer.  (Idea:  some kind of cross-pollination between Wikidata and Toolhub, whereby when a new tool is added, a new entry is automatically created on Wikidata.  Or, alternately, if a new entry is made on Wikidata, could the associated tool be automatically updated?  Would that be possible?)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Looking into it a bit more, I found, for instance, that \"pywikibot\" has a Wikimedia entry that contains more information than its Toolhub entry.  Interesting.  But since there's no guarantee that a given tool would have an extensive Wikimedia entry, I still think that the value of this field is not particularly valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  translate_url: \"A link to the tool's translation interface.\"  I am honestly not sure what this means.  A link to translated documentation?  Does it duplicate \"available_ui_languages\"?  It is unclear, and thus not particularly useful."

I had initially thought that using `/api/tools` would be more useful for a bulk search, but discovered quite by accident that making a request to the `/api/search/tools` endpoint without adding a search parameter (or adding one that wasn't formatted properly, in my case) will return the full list of tools. The response also includes a lot of additional information, though admittedly it's the same information available in the sidebar at https://toolhub.wikimedia.org/search?ordering=-score&page=1&page_size=12\n",

    "**TODO**: Reflect on the following questions, and try to answer them to the best of your ability. These are open-ended questions and there's likely more than one good way to do things. Explaining your reasoning and discussing the pros and cons of different approaches is more important than arriving at the \"right\" answer.\n",

    "I believe that the most “important” fields are those which will provide the most information to users and contributors (but especially to users).   Of the “Annotations” keys, I stand by my assertion that “repository_url” is the most valuable and should be prioritized.  Perhaps it would be possible to prioritize or suggest related tasks – so, if, for instance, a user finds and submits a value for “repository_url” the app could suggest “bugtracker_url” or “user_docs_url” for the same tool as a follow-up task for the same user (assuming that those values are also missing, which the above data suggests is more likely than not).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thought: perhaps the second level of priority could go to “low hanging fruit” – questions that are likely to have a relatively easy-to-find answer.  For instance, if “repository” has a value for a particular tool, but related keys do not, the task could be flagged as higher priority and the app could offer the suggestion that the user could “check the (linked) repository” for the information.  In other words, tasks could be weighted like this:  if “bugtracker_url” == [] and “repository_url” != [], then the task has a higher priority.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(As a side note, “wikidata_qid” seems like it could possibly fall into the category of “low hanging fruit,” but it seems to me that there must surely be a way to scrape the Wikidata entries and automatically update the values if an associated Wikidata entry is found.  Perhaps someone should write a tool…)  \n",

    "- The user should have the option to skip a task and move on to the next one. A reason for skipping could be that the user tried to find the requested information, but failed. Do you think we should gather this information, for instance by having the user check a box indicating their \"skip reason\" before being able to click skip? What other possible skip reasons could you think of. Could this information be useful when deciding which tasks to show to which users, when to show a given task again, etc.?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it that such an option would be useful, though I don’t think that it should be mandatory – i.e., that the user must check a box before being allowed to skip.  (This is more of a personal preference, because I hate it when sites do that.)    Other skip reasons I could think of would simply be that the user decided that they didn’t have time to look, or weren’t interested in the particular tool, or lost interest for some other reason – reasons like that, however, don’t strike me as particularly useful for the purpose of task prioritization.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m imagining a checkbox next to a “skip” button that’s labeled “Information could not be found” (or something along those lines); if checked, perhaps that could flag the task, with the result that the task would be pushed further down the queue.  If we’re aware that certain information simply doesn’t exist (i.e., there simply is no “privacy_policy_url” then it is a waste of time to keep showing it.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing that would concern me (and this is another reason why I wouldn’t want to demand that a box be checked) is the possibility of false negatives – of a user casually checking the box without having actually looked for the information.  Perhaps it would be better to set a certain threshold – say, if a task is flagged 2 or more times, then it gets pushed down.  Or the task queue could simply be weighted to preference tasks that didn’t have any flags, and the more flags a task gets, the further down it drops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The question of which tasks to show to which users is an interesting one.  Perhaps some users really would be more interested in searching for particular items.  A checkbox that indicates “I am not interested in this task” is a little too vague to be useful and would need to be followed up with a lot of questions; my preference would be to explicitly ask users, perhaps as part of registration for the app, if there are particular fields that they would like to search for.\n",

    "\n",
    "I really have no idea if this would be feasible, but my first thought is to imagine setting a timestamp on a task when it’s called up from the queue – something like, “last_accessed_at.”  When someone loads the web app the first task is taken from the queue  - but before it’s sent to the client, the value of the timestamp is checked against the current time.  If the difference between those values is too small (I don’t know what a reasonable window would be – 30 minutes?  An hour?) then the task will be returned to the queue and the next task evaluated along the same lines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to over-complicate matters, “skipping” the task could reset the timestamp, as we’d know that it was no longer actively being worked on.  (Obviously if a task was completed it would be removed from the queue entirely, and the presence and value of the flag wouldn’t matter.)  I wouldn’t want the task’s status to rest entirely on the “skip,” however – what if the user just closes their browser window?    The task will need to return to circulation on its own somehow.  (Which is why I favor the idea of evaluating a timestamp as opposed to setting something like a “currently_in_use” flag.)\n"
