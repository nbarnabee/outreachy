This task is one of two application microtasks for T317083



Steps to follow

    Create a Frontend project with support for Unit Testing.
    Initialise Git on the project, if you haven't done so already, and add the remote url of your repository.
    Add the boilerplate code into a commit. The commit message guidelines used by developers in the foundation might be useful when creating your commits.
    Push up the change to the repository hosting service of your choice.
    Design 3 Mock pages: Home, Leaderboard, and a Records Dashboard. You are required to build this pages with hardcoded strings, that means none of this pages should make request to the API for data. Feel free to be creative with your designs, and you can also seek some inspiration from the Citation Hunt tool.
    Each page should have a Navigation bar containing links to the other pages.
    The Dashboard is required to show the following metrics with mock figures (feel free to add other analytics you think may be useful to monitor): Total number of Tools in the records, number of tools with missing information, percentage of tools with missing information compared with the total number of tools in the records, number of tools edited using this record management tool

Dashboard:

- The "My Edits" section would reference the user's most recent contributions
- "Latest Activity" would draw on the latest global contributions
